# about-me


TECHNOLOGIES I USED: 

-CSS: REGULAR CSS STYLING AND THEN ADDED IN BOOTSTRAP FOR THE HAMBURGER NAV BAR ANC CAROUSEL. I ALSO ADDED A LIBRARY TO TRY TO GET THE CAROUSEL IMAGES TO POP OUT.

-JAVASCRIPT: I USED JQUERY AND MAINLY USED LOOPING OR BUILT IN FUNCTIONS THAT CAME WITH THE BOOTSTRAP LINKS TO GET MY ELEMENTS WORKING ON THE PAGE.

-HTML - THE BARE BONES USED TO DEVELOP THE SITE.

- I ADDED A SPOTIFY WIDGET TO A SET PLAYLIST THAT I LIKE TO LISTEN TO.


UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:

ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS I HAD WAS TRYING TO GET THE POP OUT IMAGES TO WORK. THEY WOULD OPEN THE IMAGE IN A NEW PAGE AND SHOW THE FILE AS THE URL INSTEAD OF IT POPPING UP IN THE ALREADY OPENED WINDOW.
I ALSO HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSITION FADING. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE TESTIMONIALS TO JUMP USING AN LOOP WITH AN ARRAY AND SETTING A TIMER FOR EACH SLIDE. 


MY THOUGH PROCESS:

WHEN MAKING THIS SITE I STARTED BY WIREFRAMING IT ON THE WHITEBOARD. I WANTED A MORE ART DECO VINTAGE KIND OF FEEL.  IT ENDED UP BEING LESS OF THAT AND MORE OF A SIMPLISTIC VIEW FOR READABILITY CONCERNS. (MY PAGE WAS USING TOO DARK OF COLORS). ONCE I REALIZED I NEEDED TO GO LESS ON THE STYLING I RE STYLED MY SITE TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING TO THE EYES. 

MY BIGGEST WIN:    

I WOULD HAVE TO SAY MY BIGGEST WIN WAS 
    A) GETTING THE LIBRARIES UP AND RUNNING. THIS IS THE FIRST PROJECT I'VE USED THEM SO I DEFINITELY GOT A LOT OF PRACTICE IN HOW TO MANUEVER THROUGH THE LIBRARY AND ATTACH THE CORRECT LINKS. I ALSO USED A PARTICLE.JS THEME FOR THE BACKGROUND OF THE FORM AND THAT TURNED OUT REALLY COOL. I HAD SOME DIFFICUTLY GETTING IT RUNNING BUT WITH DALTON'S HELP WE MANAGED TO GET THEM TO SHOW UP.
    
B)  ANOTHER BIG WIN WAS BEING ABLE TO EFFORTLESSLY PUT THE HEADER TOGETHER. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS WITH CONSTRUCTING IT BUT TAKING THIS COURSE HAS MADE IT A BREEZE.
